#pycoinflip: Python Coinflip
A simple coin flip generator that runs on Python2.
It calculates whether the imaginary coin lands heads up or tails up
based on the "random" Python module. The "random" module allows the
program to pick up any floating-point number between 0 and 1. If the
result of the "random" computation is less than 0.5, the result is heads.
Otherwise, the result is tails.
